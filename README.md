# Reinforcement_Learning_for_Climate_Policies

we introduced a deep deterministic policy gradient approach for finding an optimal policy
in the economic climate model of the 2013 version of DICE. (Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy)


We show that DDPG learns a policy that achieves the same discounted reward over 600 years up to
99.5 percent as a benchmark policy with a Dynamic Programming approach. For more information read our attached paper.
